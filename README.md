## Gameplay
The objective of the game is to match the relative speed of the debris which is moving in a keplerian orbit (defined by the TLE data fetched from XXXXXXXXX) and collect it for resources. The resources can be used to upgrade the debris collection mechanism for faster collection speed, more range, etc.
